# Free Range Routing (FRR) Exporter

Prometheus exporter for FRR version 3.0+ that collects metrics by using `vtysh` and exposes them via HTTP, ready for collecting by Prometheus.

## Getting Started
To run frr_exporter:
```
./frr_exporter [flags]
```

To view metrics on the default port (9342) and path (/metrics):
```
http://device:9342/metrics
```

To view available flags:
```
usage: frr_exporter [<flags>]

Flags:
  -h, --help                     Show context-sensitive help (also try --help-long and --help-man).
      --collector.bgp.peer-types
                                 Enable the frr_bgp_peer_types_up metric (default: disabled).
      --collector.bgp.peer-types.keys=type ...
                                 Select the keys from the JSON formatted BGP description of which the values will be used with the frr_bgp_peer_types_up metric.
                                 Supports multiple values (default: type).
      --collector.bgp.peer-descriptions
                                 Add the value of the desc key from a JSON formatted BGP peer description as a label to peer metrics. (default: disabled).
      --collector.bgp.peer-descriptions.plain-text
                                 Use the full text field of the BGP peer description instead of the value of the JSON formatted desc key (default: disabled).
      --collector.bgp.advertised-prefixes
                                 Enables the frr_exporter_bgp_prefixes_advertised_count_total metric which exports the number of advertised prefixes to a BGP peer. This is an option for older versions of FRR that don't have PfxSent

Promethues configuraiton:
```
scrape_configs:

## Collectors
To disable a default collector, use the `--no-collector.$name` flag, or
`--collector.$name` to enable it.

### Enabled by Default

### VTYSH
The vtysh command is heavily utilised to extract metrics from FRR. The default timeout is 20s but can be modified via the `--frr.vtysh.timeout` flag.

### BGP: Peer Description Labels
The description of a BGP peer can be added as a label to all peer metrics by passing the `--collector.bgp.peer-descriptions` flag. The peer description must be JSON formatted with a `desc` field. Example configuration:

```
router bgp 64512
 neighbor 192.168.0.1 remote-as 64513
 neighbor 192.168.0.1 description {"desc":"important peer"}
```

If an unstructured description is preferred, additionally to `--collector.bgp.peer-descriptions` pass the `--collector.bgp.peer-descriptions.plain-text` flag. Example configuration:

```
router bgp 64512
 neighbor 192.168.0.1 remote-as 64513
 neighbor 192.168.0.1 description important peer
```

Note, it is recommended to leave this feature disabled as peer descriptions can easily change, resulting in a new time series.

### BGP: Advertised Prefixes to a Peer
This is an option for older versions of FRR. If your FRR shows the "PfxSnt" field for Peers in the Established state in the output of "show bgp summary json", you don't need to enable this option.

The number of prefixes advertised to a BGP peer can be enabled (i.e. the `frr_exporter_bgp_prefixes_advertised_count_total` metric) by passing the `--collector.bgp.advertised-prefixes` flag. Please note, FRR does not expose a summary of prefixes advertised to BGP peers, so each peer needs to be queried individually. For example, if 20 BGP peers are configured, 20 `vtysh -c 'sh ip bgp neigh X.X.X.X advertised-routes json'` commands are executed. This can be slow -- the commands are executed in parallel by frr_exporter, but vtysh/FRR seems to execute them in serial. Due to the potential negative performance implications of running `vtysh` for every BGP peer, this metric is disabled by default.

### BGP: frr_bgp_peer_types_up
FRR Exporter exposes a special metric, `frr_bgp_peer_types_up`, that can be used in scenarios where you want to create Prometheus queries that report on the number of types of BGP peers that are currently established, such as for Alertmanager. To implement this metric, a JSON formatted description must be configured on your BGP group. FRR Exporter will then use the value from the keys specific by the `--collector.bgp.peer-types.keys` flag (the default is `type`), and aggregate all BGP peers that are currently established and configured with that type.

For example, if you want to know how many BGP peers are currently established that provide internet, you'd set the description of all BGP groups that provide internet to `{"type":"internet"}` and query Prometheus with `frr_bgp_peer_types_up{type="internet"})`. Going further, if you want to create an alert when the number of established BGP peers that provide internet is 1 or less, you'd use `sum(frr_bgp_peer_types_up{type="internet"}) <= 1`.

To enable `frr_bgp_peer_types_up`, use the `--collector.bgp.peer-types` flag.
